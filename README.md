### A software engineer working with embedded system and APIs, heavily influencied by Go's philosophy of simplicity and performance!

Currently I am working with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) related stuff from the _init_ to the cluster management, also I am very experienced with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and its heart called [containerd](https://containerd.io).<br>
Since I deal with such softwares a lot I have gotten an awesome knowledge in the Go programming language, from consuming and creating APIs to managing the operating system network stack alongside its powerful synchronization for multi-threading tasks.<br>
As of my past experience with TypeScript and the Node.js world, I am very familiar with the software going there too! I am always creating with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
